# Lost-and-Found

Losing personal belongings, such as keys, wallets, or electronic devices, is a common and stressful experience. This proposal outlines a solution: a publicly hosted web application designed to streamline the lost and found process, connecting people who have lost items with those who have found them, within a specific geographic area.
