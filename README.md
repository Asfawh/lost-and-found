# Lost-and-Found

Losing personal belongings, such as keys, wallets, or electronic devices, is a common and stressful experience. This proposal outlines a solution: a publicly hosted web application designed to streamline the lost and found process, connecting people who have lost items with those who have found them, within a specific geographic area.

# More stuffs to do:

- implement images to the form and detail pages
- Search bar and query to span query terms
- comment section by a user to a specific item details
- To implement an Address Validation API with autocomplete in a React form,
- Deploy to aws cloud
